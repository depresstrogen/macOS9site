# macOS9site
My best attempt at making a website feel like late classic mac OS\
2nd ever project using JS, The first being https://github.com/rllyp/covid \
Not trying to be 100% accurate to the original due to the web being weird and people running chrome on refrigerators but i hope it feels like the 14 year olds who make instagram collages with the mac OS titlebar wish it looked
